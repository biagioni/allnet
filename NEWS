2017/06/19: release 3.2.2
  Improved reliability of message delivery, is now usable on iOS and is
  available for generic arm linux computers

2016/05/10: release 3.2.1
  Works well on linux, Mac/OSX, and Windows under Cygwin.  Main improvement
  is more reliable delivery of messages, but many other improvements too.
  Preliminary port to iOS.

2014/03/25: release 3.0
  Everything on the command line works (pidgin has not been tested yet).

  Major changes from version 2:
    - New packet header format, more regular and easier to use
      supports streams and large messages
      acks are end-to-end for encrypted data, and hop-by-hop for broadcast data
    - trace program, equivalent of ping and traceroute together
    - Allnet Human Readable Addresses (ahra) to subscribe to broadcasts, e.g.
          allnet_hourly_time_server@if_wish.think_past.get_future
      see the README file for more details
    - thanks mostly to AB, the implementation has a new directory
      structure, uses git, sourceforge, and automake -- see README to build
    - xchat and xkey use a different directory structure under ~/.allnet
      -- v2 keys will not work, unless moved around the file system
