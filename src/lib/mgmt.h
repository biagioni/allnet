/* management packets can be very different from each other.  Each has
 * its own header */

/* beacons are locally broadcast by wireless receivers to indicate the receiver
 * is ready to receive data.  Beacons should always be sent with hops = 0
 * and max_hops = 1, so hops and max_hops can be ignored when receiving
 * beacons.
 *
 * If I send a beacon, "destination", if any, indicates what packets I
 * am most interested in receiving, and "source", if any,
 * indicates the sender address(es) I am most interested in receiving from.
 * senders may use these to favor some among otherwise equal-priority packets.
 *
 * a beacon may also be immediately followed by a data request packet,
 * with more specific information about what is desired
 *
 * a beacon carries, in big-endian order, the length of time the receiver
 * is planning to stay awake.  The time is in nanoseconds (10^-9s).
 * A receiver who is listening continuously may use a value of 0 for the time.
 *
 * the receiver nonce identifies the ultimate data receiver, that is, the
 * device that sends the original management beacon.  The sender nonce
 * identifies the sender of data.
 *
 * Senders sleep a random time between 5ms and 15ms before replying to
 * a beacon.  Normally, at the end of a transmission, a sender will
 * issue its own beacon, and the erstwhile receiver has priority in
 * replying to that beacon -- others may reply after 5-15ms.

 * the fraction of a second is in binary, (multiplied by 2^64).
 *
 * A precision gives the number of valid bits in the fraction, and may be 0.

 * Preferably the precision should not be higher than the accuracy of
