/* message.h: provide non-volatile storage of chat messages */

/* messages are stored in each contact's directory under a day file, e.g.
 * ~/.allnet/xchat/20130101174522/20140302.txt or
 * ~/.config/allnet/xchat/20130101174522/20140302.txt
 * group messages are stored in that group's directory (not yet implemented).
 *
 * each contact may have multiple keys, and thus multiple directories.
 * Directories are indirectly identified by keys.
 * keys.c/key_dir returns a directory x as ~/.[config/]allnet/contacts/x,
 * in which case the chat information is stored under ~/.[config/]allnet/xchat/x
 *
 * note that:
 * - messages we send are sent to all instances of a given contact,
 *   so sequence numbers (and messages) we send are the same across
 *   all directories of a contact
 * - messages we receive are sent independently by each of the instances
 *   of a contact, so their sequence numbers are independent.
